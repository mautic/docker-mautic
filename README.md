# How to use this image

	docker run --name some-mautic --link some-mysql:mysql -d mautic/mautic

The following environment variables are also honored for configuring your Mautic instance:

-	`-e MAUTIC_DB_HOST=...` (defaults to the IP and port of the linked `mysql` container)
-	`-e MAUTIC_DB_USER=...` (defaults to "root")
-	`-e MAUTIC_DB_PASSWORD=...` (defaults to the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable from the linked `mysql` container)
-	`-e MAUTIC_DB_NAME=...` (defaults to "mautic")
-	`-e MAUTIC_RUN_CRON_JOBS=...` (defaults to unset, if set then all cron jobs are run every 15 minutes)

If the `MAUTIC_DB_NAME` specified does not already exist on the given MySQL server, it will be created automatically upon startup of the `mautic` container, provided that the `MAUTIC_DB_USER` specified has the necessary permissions to create it.

If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

	docker run --name some-mautic --link some-mysql:mysql -p 8080:80 -d mautic

Then, access it via `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in a browser.

If you'd like to use an external database instead of a linked `mysql` container, specify the hostname and port with `MAUTIC_DB_HOST` along with the password in `MAUTIC_DB_PASSWORD` and the username in `MAUTIC_DB_USER` (if it is something other than `root`):

	docker run --name some-mautic -e MAUTIC_DB_HOST=10.1.2.3:3306 \
	    -e MAUTIC_DB_USER=... -e MAUTIC_DB_PASSWORD=... -d mautic/mautic

## ... via [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `docker-compose.yml` for `mautic`:

	mautic:
	  image: mautic/mautic
	  links:
	    - mauticdb:mysql
	  ports:
	    - 8080:80
	
	mauticdb:
	  image: mysql:5.6
	  environment:
	    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example

Run `docker-compose up`, wait for it to initialize completely, and visit `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080`.
